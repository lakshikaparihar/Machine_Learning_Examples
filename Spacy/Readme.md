# IMDb Movie Review
This dataset has movie reviews by IMDb. What we have done is we created a classification model that looks at the review text and predicts whether a review is positive or negative.
Since this data set already includes whether a review is positive or negative in the feedback column, we can use those answers to train and test our model. 
Our goal here is to produce an accurate model that we could then use to process new user reviews and quickly determine whether they were positive or negative.
